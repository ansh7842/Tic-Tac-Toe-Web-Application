This is a fun little Tic Tac Toe game I built as part of my internship. You can play with a friend or against the computer (random moves).

Features:
- Two modes: Player vs Player and Player vs Computer
- Checks for winner or draw
- Resets the game with one click
- Simple and clean dark UI

What I learned:
- Writing game logic in JavaScript
- Updating the UI based on game state
- Used arrays and conditions to check winning combinations
- Added random move logic for computer mode

Tech used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
